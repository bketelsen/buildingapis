* HTTP/2

- Evolution of Google's SPDY
- Provides an optimized transport for HTTP semantics
- Supports header compression
- Enables multiple "streams" to share the same TCP connection
- Connection upgrades transparently on TLS negotiation
- Does not have the HTTP pipelining congestion issue

* HTTP/2 in Go

Enabled by default since Go 1.6 for both servers and clients.
No change to the `http` package usage.

* What You Need to Know

- Does not affect API design
- "just works"
- For the curious, checkout the "HTTP/2 and SPDY indicator" browser extension
