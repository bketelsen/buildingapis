# GoWorkshop Service

The `service` directory contains a fully functional service implemented using
[goa](https://github.com/goadesign/goa). This is provided as a real-world example. The service
demonstrates how to:

* Use goa to design an API
* Use [JWT](https://jwt.io) to secure an API
* Implement a logging and metrics strategy
* Use Swagger as documentation
* Write a command line tool API client

The service [README](service/README.md) contains additional details about how the service is
implemented and how to use it.
